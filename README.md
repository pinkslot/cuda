Features:
- Fast interactive GPU path tracer
- progressive rendering
- support for diffuse, specular (mirror), refractive, acrylic/coat and metal Phong materials
- support for spheres and triangle meshes
- BVH acceleration structure built with SAH (Surface Area Heuristic) and binning
- interactive camera with mouse and keyboard controls
- anti-aliasing
- depth-of-field


Instructions for compiling with Visual Studio 2013/2015:

- install the CUDA 6.5/7/7.5 toolkit and choose integration with Visual Studio
- open VS2013/2015 (Express or any other version such as the free Community version)
- click New Project...
- select Visual C++, then General, then Empty Project
- right click on the project, select Build Dependies > Build Customizations
- select the CUDA 6.5 (or 7 or 7.5) checkbox, click OK
- in the project explorer window, right click on Source Files, select Add, C++ file, then change the name from "Source.cpp" to "cuda_pathtracer.cu"
- in the project explorer window, right click on the newly created cuda_pathtracer.cu file, select CUDA C++
- paste the code from cuda_pathtracer.cu in the file
- add the other .h (header) and .cpp files to the project
- right click on the project name, select Properties
- under Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies, add "cudart.lib" and "glew32.lib" (glew32.lib should be automatically found when the CUDA toolkit is installed, if not, you can manually add the path to Linker > General > Additional Library Directories, the path is something like "%NVSDKCOMPUTE_ROOT%\C\common\lib")
- disable SAFESEH by selecting NO in Linker > Advanced > Image Has Safe Exception Handlers
- select Build > Rebuild Solution
- run the program (at the moment there is no CUDA error checking, but so far everything has worked fine even when running the program for prolonged periods)
